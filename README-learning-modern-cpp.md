# Learnign modern C++

I found  the CppCon 2015 talk _Stop Teaching C_ by Kate Gregory, very inspiring. Sadly, there seem not to be any introductory book following the best practices she outlines.

On the [pluralsight.com](http://pluralisight.com/) i could find the video course [Learn How to Program with C++](http://app.pluralsight.com/courses/learn-programming-cplusplus) by the Kate Gregory.
