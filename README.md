# C++ for beginners

Beginners workshop for c++

Concepts:

- The reader should be able to follow the steps in a autonomous way.
- We should suggest an environment for starting that is as uniform, simple, and failproof as possible.
- There should be as little explaination words per line of code as possible.
- We should be clear and explain everything the reader needs to learn, but not always explain every single detail.
- We should make it clear to the user that he/she does not need to every single detail. At the same time we should take care that she/he does not get lost.
- We should move all the "too broad" concepts (like what is a programming language) to a separate chapter or book.

# Notes

All citation that do not have a reference are from Bjarne Stroustrup, "Programming: Priciples and Pratcice Using C++", 2nd edition. They will be completed with our own ideas, shortened and finally removed as citation from this handbook.  
Of course we will mention that this has been inspired by Stroustrup's book, but at the end, our work will be very different from his book (hopefully! otherwise we could just take his book...)
